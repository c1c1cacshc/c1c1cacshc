Consumers usually are asked to provide the payment authorization as part of the process of getting the loan. The authorization will be in your loan documents, and it may have a place for you to initial as approved. If you approve, the lender will take your payments directly from your account without any further action by you. You may choose to refuse to sign the authorization.
There are a variety of payment options for payday lenders to obtain repayment. Some lenders frequently obtain multiple types of authorizations, such as taking a post-dated check along with the consumer’s debit card information.
Under federal law lenders cannot condition a payday loan on obtaining an authorization from the consumer for ‘‘preauthorized’’ (recurring) electronic fund transfers.
