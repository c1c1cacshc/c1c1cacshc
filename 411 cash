If you want to know whether a payday lender is licensed to do business in your state, verify the information with your state regulator or attorney general

Not all states allow payday lending. Some states allow payday lending and require lenders to be licensed. In some states, if a payday loan is made by a business that is not licensed in that state, the payday loan may be void. In that circumstance, the lender may not have the right to collect or require the consumer to repay the payday loan.
